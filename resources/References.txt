Important to note that this is something to augment the unit tests, not completely replace them.


TODO:
- Find some background on QuickCheck
- Maybe an example of "significantly" more advanced: http://www.quviq.com/index.html for Erlang, considering that I was not able to make the ScalaCheck concurrent test work as expected.
